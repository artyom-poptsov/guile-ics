* Unreleased
** =ics= program is improved
*** =print=: New command
iCalendar/vCard printer that prints the data in the specified format ("pretty"
and "org-mode" are available for now.)
*** =describe=: New command
This command allows to get human-readable description of iCalendar/vCard data.
*** =convert=: New command.
=ics convert= allows to convert DSV data to iCalendar/vCard format.

As a practical example, this is very useful for producing vCard contact data
from table data (e.g. from ODS files) for mass-importing contacts into a
applications.
** Guile-ICS now can read vCard format
As vCard (RFC 6350) format is very similar to iCalendar (RFC 5545), it seems
reasonable to support both in one library/tool.

There are unfinished parts in vCard support but that will be fixed in future
Guile-ICS releases.
** =(ics)=: =ics-describe= is now more informative

* Changes in version 0.3.0 (2022-09-03)
** Use the Guile State Machine Compiler (Guile-SMC)
Guile-ICS now uses Guile-SMC for generating the code for its finite-state
machine.
** API changes
*** =(ics fsm)= module is removed
*** =(ics type property ...)= now =(ics type ...)=
All the modules from =modules/ics/type/property= directory are moved to
=modules/ics/type=.
*** =(ics type stream)= now =(ics stream)=
*** =(ics type object)= now =(ics object)=
*** =(ics type property)= now =(ics property)=
** Documentation update
** Add new tests

* Changes in version 0.2.1 (2022-05-10)
** Guile-ICS now uses SRFI-64 that comes with Guile
** Guile-ICS now builds with Guile 3.0+
** =(ics version)=: New module
The module contains procedures that allow to get Guile-ICS version in various
forms.
** Add a GNU Guix recipe to the repository
Now the project can be built and installed as follows:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
guix build -f ./guix.scm
guix package -f ./guix.scm
#+END_EXAMPLE
** =ics= command now handles =--version= option
** Generate a man-page from =ics= output.

* Changes in version 0.2.0 (2017-12-25)
** The library is mostly re-written with GOOPS
   Now most of the API is object-oriented.
** Added support for iCalendar property value types
** New features
*** The library now supports lists of values (RFC 5545, 3.1.1.)
*** The library now handles escaped chars in TEXT values (RFC 5545, 3.3.11)
** Bugfixes
*** Remove bogus dependency on 'guile-lib'
    There was an extra dependency on (scheme documentation) module
    that I overlooked in the previous release, which is now removed.
** Added the project logo
** Documentation is updated
** Examples are updated
** Unit tests updated; new tests added

* Changes in version 0.1.1 (2017-01-07)
** Bugfixes
*** Fixed library building scripts
    Autotools would fail to build the library and run tests due to an
    error in Automake files.  The patch fixes that.
*** Remove bogus dependency on 'guile-lib' package
    Some modules used 'define-with-docs' which is part of 'guile-lib'
    package.  The dependency was not documented and lead to errors
    when the 'guile-lib' was missing.

    The dependency was removed as it seems not worthy of requiring the
    whole library only just for 'define-with-docs' facilities.

* Changes in version 0.1.0 (2017-01-07)
** Release of the first stable version of Guile-ICS
