Usage ics [command] [options]

The default behaviour of the program is to read iCalendar/vCard stream from
stdin and handle it according to the specified options.

Commands:
  print          Print the input iCalendar data in various formats.
                 This is the default action if no command is provided.
  describe       Describe the input iCalendar data in the human-readable
                 form.
  convert        Convert data to the vCard/iCalendar format.
  help           Print this help message.
  version        Print the Guile-ICS version.

Options:
  --help, -h                 Print this message and exit.
  --version                  Print Guile-ICS version.

For each command there's '--help' option (or '-h' for short) that prints a help
message for the given command.
