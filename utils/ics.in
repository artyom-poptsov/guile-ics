Usage ics [options]

The default behaviour of the program is to read iCalendar stream from
stdin and handle it according to the specified options.

Options:
  --help, -h                 Print this message and exit.
  --pretty-print, -p <indent>
                             Pretty-print iCalendar stream to the
                             stdout.
  --to-org-mode              Convert iCalendar data to org-mode format.
