* Requirements

* Usage
   Let's suppose you have a file named =example.ics= with the
   following content:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
VERSION:2.0
PRODID:-//hacksw/handcal//NONSGML v1.0//EN
BEGIN:VEVENT
UID:19970610T172345Z-AF23B2@example.com
DTSTAMP:19970610T172345Z
DTSTART:19970714T170000Z
DTEND:19970715T040000Z
SUMMARY:Bastille Day Party
END:VEVENT
END:VCALENDAR
#+END_EXAMPLE

   The following example shows how to parse the file:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE scheme
(use-modules (ics))

(let* ((port       (open-input-file "example.ics"))
       (ics-object (car (ics->scm port))))
  (ics-pretty-print ics-object #:show-types? #t))
#+END_EXAMPLE

   The code produces the following output:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
BEGIN: VCALENDAR
  PRODID (TEXT): -//hacksw/handcal//NONSGML v1.0//EN
  VERSION (TEXT): 2.0
  BEGIN: VEVENT
    SUMMARY (TEXT): Bastille Day Party
    DTEND (DATE-TIME): 19970715T040000Z
    DTSTART (DATE-TIME): 19970714T170000Z
    DTSTAMP (DATE-TIME): 19970610T172345Z
    UID (TEXT): 19970610T172345Z-AF23B2@example.com
  END: VEVENT
END: VCALENDAR
#+END_EXAMPLE

   Now let's take a look on the =ics-object= structure more closely:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE scheme
(use-modules (ics))

(let* ((port       (open-input-file "example.ics"))
       (ics-object (car (ics->scm port))))
  (ics-describe ics-object))
#+END_EXAMPLE

   After we run the code we will see the following:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;;; #<<class> <ics-object> ea4f30>                 VCALENDAR
;;;   properties:
;;;     #<<class> <ics-property> e573f0>           PRODID               TEXT
;;;     #<<class> <ics-property> e573f0>           VERSION              TEXT
;;;   components:
;;;     #<<class> <ics-object> ea4f30>             VEVENT
#+END_EXAMPLE

   As can be seen from the example, the =<ics-object>= with name
   =VCALENDAR= has two properties of type =TEXT= (=PRODID=, and
   =VERSION=) and has one an only =VEVENT= component.  The
   =ics-describe= method may be handy in REPL mode to get information
   about iCalendar objects.  Now let's get the value of =SUMMARY=
   property that belongs to the =VEVENT= component:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE scheme
(use-modules (ics)
             (ics type object)
             (ics type property))

(let* ((port       (open-input-file "example.ics"))
       (ics-object (car (ics->scm port)))
       (vevent     (car (ics-object-components ics-object))))
  (display
   (ics-property-value (ics-object-property-ref vevent "SUMMARY")))
  (newline))

#+END_EXAMPLE

   When run, the example prints the following:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Bastille Day Party
#+END_EXAMPLE
